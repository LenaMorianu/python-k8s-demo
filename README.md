# Impact Labs Summit 2020

## Container and Container Orchestration

This is a very simple demo application to demonstrate container technologies and container orchestration. Hopefully by the end of this we will all learn some useful basics. 

## Docker

Docker is almost synonymous with container technologies and for good reason. They were one of the first in the industry to make it easy for developers to create containers.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a container orchestrator. In simple terms what it means is that it makes sure containers run in the given infrastructure. It does much more than that but for our use case this is enough. 

## The Application

Full disclaimer I am not a python developer. But when I thought about creating this demo I thought what language would be most accessible to most attendees. Python was the clear winner.
